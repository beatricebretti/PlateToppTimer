# PlateToppTimer App

This is a kitchen timer app built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and JavaScript. It allows users to set timers for different kitchen plates and keeps track of the countdowns on a kitchen counter interface. The app provides a user-friendly interface to control multiple timers simultaneously.

## Credits
- **Design & Concept**: Kristoffer c:  
  Came up with the original idea and created the visual design and user interface of the app.
- **Coding**: [Beatrice Valdés Bretti](https://www.beatricevaldesbretti.com) :
  Developed the app functionality and implemented the features.
  
## Features

- **Multiple Timer Support**: Set individual timers for up to four different kitchen plates.
- **Custom Timer Setup**: Set custom hours, minutes, and seconds for each timer using a picker.
- **Kitchen Counter**: A kitchen counter screen showing the active timers and their countdowns.
- **Alarm System**: A section to display the timers for each plate (static, not counting down).
- **Smooth Navigation**: Easy navigation between the timer setup and the main kitchen counter screens.
- **Expo Integration**: Built using Expo for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).
